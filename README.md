# Machina Imperium

A multiplayer nation simulation game inspired by *NationStates*, where players create nations aligned with their political ideals and compete against AI-controlled nations led by historical personalities. Every decision shapes your nation's future, influencing alliances and economic growth. As a PvP experience, nations strive to achieve the highest GDP while forging strategic partnerships with AI-driven nations. 
  
This game serves as an experiment in human-in-the-loop agentic gameplay and autonomous agent-to-agent interactions, where emergent narratives unfold through dynamic decision-making.  

Both human and AI-led nations must navigate complex socio-political and economic dilemmas, shaping their national policies over time. Decisions impact a nation's **political freedom, economic freedom, and civil liberties**, gradually shifting its dominant ideology. As nations react to evolving internal and external pressures, they may transform from capitalist democracies to totalitarian regimesâ€”or vice versa.

     - Economic Freedom alignment
     - Civil Rights compatibility
     - Political Freedom similarity
     - Overall ideology match

5. **Winner Calculations**

## Ideologies and Metrics

![alt text](image-2.png)

Nations are measured on three key metrics:
- **Economic Freedom** (0-100)
- **Civil Rights** (0-100)
- **Political Freedom** (0-100)

These metrics evolve based on decisions and determine the nation's governing ideology, ranging from "Psychotic Dictatorship" to "Anarchy" with 27 possible forms of government.

## **How Countries Are Put into Ideological Buckets Using 1-NN**  

We use **1-Nearest Neighbor (1-NN)**, a simplified KNN, to classify countries into ideological groups based on three freedoms:  

1. **Economic Freedom** (how free the market is)  
2. **Civil Rights** (how much personal freedom people have)  
3. **Political Freedom** (how fair and open the government is)  

Each country is represented as a **point in 3D space**, with coordinates:  
```
(Economic Freedom, Civil Rights, Political Freedom)
```

## **Step-by-Step Process**  

### **1. Measure Distance**  
   - We calculate the **Euclidean distance** between a new country and all known countries:  

$$
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + + (z_2 - z_1)^2}
$$
   
   - This tells us which country is the **most similar** in terms of freedom.

### **2. Find the Nearest Neighbor**  
   - The country that is **closest** in this 3D space is chosen as the **best match**.

### **3. Assign the Ideological Bucket**  
   - The new country is placed into the **same bucket** as its nearest neighbor.  



### **Example**  

- A new country has scores **(7, 5, 6)**.  
- We check the distance to all known countries.  
- The closest country is in the "Social Democracy" bucket.  
- So, the new country is classified as a **Social Democracy** too.
